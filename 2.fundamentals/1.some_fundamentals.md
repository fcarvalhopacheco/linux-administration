# Finding files 

+ To locate a file or directory you can use the find command.
+ It can be used to find files by name, size, permissions, owner, modification time, and more.

```shell
find . -name pattern # Displays files whose name matches pattern. This is case sensitive. find . -iname pattern - Same as -name , but ignores case.
find . -ls # Performs an ls on each of the found files or directories.
find . -mtime num_days # Finds files that are num_days old.
find . -size num # Finds file that are of size num.
find . -newer file # Finds files that are newer than file.
find . -exec command {} \; # Run command against all the files that are found.
```

# Wildcards

## `*` - Matches zero or more characters.
```shell
ls *.txt     
ls a*
ls a*.txt
```

## `?` - Matches exactly one character.

```shell
ls ?.txt
ls a?
ls a?.txt
```
## `[]` - A character class.

+ Matches any of the characters  included between the brackts `[aeiou]`
```shell
ls ca[nt]*.txt
```
+ It would return ,if existed, `.txt` like:

```shell
can.txt
cat.txt
candy.txt
catch.txt
```

```shell
ls [a-g]*  # Matches all files that start with a,b,c,d,e,f or g
ls [1-3]*  # Matches all files that start with 3,4,5,or 6
```

# Input, Output

+ There are 3 types of `I/O` - Input/Output:

|     I/O Name      |  Abbreviation  |  File Desctriptor  |
|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
|  Standard Input   |    `stdin`     |         0          |
|  Standard Output  |    `stdout`    |         1          |
|  Standard Error   |    `stderr`    |         2          |

## Redirection
|    Symbol    |                                 Note                                 |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     `>`      |          Redirects standard output to a file. `Overwrites`           |
|     `>>`     |            Redirects standard output to a file. `Appends`            |
|     `<`      |               Redirects input from a file to a command               |
|     `&`      | Used with redirection to signal that a file descriptor is being used |
|    `2>&1`    |                  Combine stderr and standard output                  |
|   `2>file`   |                  Redirect standard error to a file                   |
| `>/dev/null` |                      Redirect output to nowhere                      |

+ Here is some examples:

```shell
>ls -l > file.txt
>ls >> file.txt 
>cat file.txt    # this should show results from both commands 
```

```shell
>ls file.txt not-here
ls: not-here: No such file or directory
file.txt

>ls file.txt not-here > out
>cat out
file.txt

>ls file.txt not-here 2> out.err   # this gets the error msg 
> cat out.err                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ─╯
ls: not-here: No such file or directory


> ls file.txt not-here 1>out 2>out.err  #1> = stdout; 2> = stderr 
>cat out
file.txt

>cat out.err
ls: not-here: No such file or directory


>ls file.txt not-here > out.both 2>&1 # save both in the same file
cat out.both
ls: not-here: No such file or directory
file.txt

# Ignore errors by using `Null device`
>ls file.txt not-here 2>/dev/null
file.txt
```
