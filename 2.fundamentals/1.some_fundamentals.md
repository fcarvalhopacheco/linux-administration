# Finding files 

+ To locate a file or directory you can use the find command.
+ It can be used to find files by name, size, permissions, owner, modification time, and more.

```shell
find . -name pattern # Displays files whose name matches pattern. This is case sensitive. find . -iname pattern - Same as -name , but ignores case.
find . -ls # Performs an ls on each of the found files or directories.
find . -mtime num_days # Finds files that are num_days old.
find . -size num # Finds file that are of size num.
find . -newer file # Finds files that are newer than file.
find . -exec command {} \; # Run command against all the files that are found.
```

# Wildcards

## `*` - Matches zero or more characters.
```shell
ls *.txt     
ls a*
ls a*.txt
```

## `?` - Matches exactly one character.

```shell
ls ?.txt
ls a?
ls a?.txt
```
## `[]` - A character class.

+ Matches any of the characters  included between the brackts `[aeiou]`
```shell
ls ca[nt]*.txt
```
+ It would return ,if existed, `.txt` like:

```shell
can.txt
cat.txt
candy.txt
catch.txt
```

```shell
ls [a-g]*  # Matches all files that start with a,b,c,d,e,f or g
ls [1-3]*  # Matches all files that start with 3,4,5,or 6
```

# Input, Output

+ There are 3 types of `I/O` - Input/Output:

|     I/O Name      |  Abbreviation  |  File Desctriptor  |
|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
|  Standard Input   |    `stdin`     |         0          |
|  Standard Output  |    `stdout`    |         1          |
|  Standard Error   |    `stderr`    |         2          |

## Redirection
|    Symbol    |                                 Note                                 |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     `>`      |          Redirects standard output to a file. `Overwrites`           |
|     `>>`     |            Redirects standard output to a file. `Appends`            |
|     `<`      |               Redirects input from a file to a command               |
|     `&`      | Used with redirection to signal that a file descriptor is being used |
|    `2>&1`    |                  Combine stderr and standard output                  |
|   `2>file`   |                  Redirect standard error to a file                   |
| `>/dev/null` |                      Redirect output to nowhere                      |

+ Some examples:

```shell
>ls -l > file.txt
>ls >> file.txt 
>cat file.txt    # this should show results from both commands 
```

```shell
>ls file.txt not-here
ls: not-here: No such file or directory
file.txt

>ls file.txt not-here > out
>cat out
file.txt

>ls file.txt not-here 2> out.err   # this gets the error msg 
> cat out.err                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ─╯
ls: not-here: No such file or directory


> ls file.txt not-here 1>out 2>out.err  #1> = stdout; 2> = stderr 
>cat out
file.txt

>cat out.err
ls: not-here: No such file or directory


>ls file.txt not-here > out.both 2>&1 # save both in the same file
cat out.both
ls: not-here: No such file or directory
file.txt

# Ignore errors by using `Null device`
>ls file.txt not-here 2>/dev/null
file.txt
```

# Comparing Files

|        Command        |            Notes             |
|:---------------------:|:----------------------------:|
|  `diff file1 file2`   |      Compare two files       |
|  `sdiff file1 file2`  |   Side-by-side comparison    |
| `vimdiff file1 files` | Highlight differences in vim |

# Search files sing pipes

|  Command  |                    Notes                    |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
|  `grep`   |      Display lines matching a pattern       |
| `grep -i` |      Perform a search, ignoring a case      |
| `grep -c` |       Count the number of occurrences       |
| `grep -n` |      Precede output with line numbers       |
| `grep -v` | Invert Match. Print lines that don't match  |


+ Example. Let's create a file called `file1.txt` and the following text.

```shell
touch file1.txt
vi file1.txt

user_name: Fernando C. Pacheco                                                 
email1: iwanttosurf@today.com                                             
email2: iwanttosurf@tomorrow.aswell.com                                            
phone: +123456789
```

+ Now we can use `grep`

```shell
> grep user_name file1.txt                                                                                                                                                                                                              ─╯
user_name: Fernando C. Pacheco    

# Ignore case
>grep -i User file1.txt                                                                                                                                                                                                                ─╯
user_name: Fernando C. Pacheco    

# Combine cases (Ignore case and show lines)
>grep -in EMAIL file1.txt                                                                                                                                                                                                              ─╯
2:email1: iwanttosurf@today.com                                             
3:email2: iwanttosurf@tomorrow.aswell.com     
```

+ Let's use some `pipes`



|  Command   |                Notes                 |
|:----------:|:------------------------------------:|
|   `cut`    |  Cut out selected portions of file   |
|  `cut -d`  | Use delimiter as the field separator |
| `cut -f N` |        Display the Nth field         |

```shell
>cat file1.txt | grep user_name   
user_name: Fernando C. Pacheco  

>cat file1.txt | grep user_name  | cut -d' ' -f4   # space is the delimiter and we want the fourth field
Pacheco
 
```

+ More pipe examples:
1. Cut the out put using : as delimeter and grab the first and the fifth result. Also `sort` the result 
2. Sort the output by using `sort` command.
3. Change from `:` to espace `" "` by using `tr` command.
4. Transform result in table by using `column -t` command.
`cut -d: -f1,5 | sort | tr ":" " " | column -t`

# Crontab 

+ `cron` is a time based job scheduling service
+ `crontab` is a program to create, read, updated and delete your jobs schedules
+ Use `cron` to schedule and automate tasks.


+ Each line in a `crontab` represents a job and contains `when` and `what` to run.

```
* * * * * command
| | | | |
| | | | +-- Day of the Week   (0-6)
